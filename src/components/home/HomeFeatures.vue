      <Feature>
        <h3>JAMstack made simple</h3>
        <p>The Modern Web is decoupled and modular. Gridsome makes it painlessly easy to build <g-link to="/docs/jamstack">JAMstack</g-link> websites using data from multiple sources such as Content API's, Headless CMSs and other web services.</p>
      </Feature>

      <Feature>
        <h3>Performance-first architecture</h3>
        <p>Gridsome loads only the critical HTML, CSS and JavaScript so your site <strong>loads as fast as possible</strong>.  Once loaded, Gridsome prefetches resources for other pages so clicking around the site feels incredible fast.
        </p>     
      </Feature>

      <Feature>
        <h3>PWAs with PRPL-pattern</h3>
        <p>Build beautiful, offline-ready, static <strong>PWAs</strong> with Gridsome. Gridsome builds ultra high performance into every page by following the <g-link to="/docs/how-it-works#the-prpl-pattern">PRPL-pattern</g-link>. A pattern for structuring and serving Progressive Web Apps. 
        </p>
      </Feature>

      <Feature>
        <h3>Simple, safe deployment</h3>
        <p>No servers. No databases. Only files. Forget complicated deploys with databases and servers and their expensive, maintenance, and scaling fears. Deploy your entire site to a CDN and forget about it.
        </p>     
      </Feature>

      <Feature>
        <h3>SEO-friendly SPAs</h3>
        <p>Gridsome sites loads as static HTML before it hydrates into a fully Vue.js-powered SPA. This makes it possible for search engines able to crawl content and give better SEO ranking, and still have all the power of Vue.js.</p>
      </Feature>

# Get started with Gridsome


## Prerequisites
You should have basic knowledge about HTML, CSS, [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) and how to use the [Terminal](https://www.linode.com/docs/tools-reference/tools/using-the-terminal/). Knowing how [GraphQL](https://www.graphql.com/) works is a plus, but not required. Gridsome is a great way to learn it.

Gridsome requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v8.3+) and recommends [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com).

## How to install

### 1. Install Gridsome CLI tool

- Using **YARN:**  `yarn global add @gridsome/cli`
- Using **NPM:**  `npm install --global @gridsome/cli`

### 2. Create a Gridsome project

1. `gridsome create my-gridsome-site` to create a new project </li>
2. `cd my-gridsome-site` to open folder
3. `gridsome develop` to start local dev server at `http://localhost:8080`
4. Happy coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ

### 3. Next steps

1. Create `.vue` components in the `/pages` directory to create page routes.
2. Use `gridsome build` to generate static files in a `/dist` folder

## Alternatives

-    **[VuePress.](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)** Another static site generator for Vue.js. It uses local markdown files for content and is perfect for documentation sites. It is possible to build anything in VuePress and Markdown (Like a blog f.ex).

-    **[Nuxt.](https://nuxtjs.org/)** A Universal Vue.js Framework for server-side rendered (SSR) apps and websites. It also has a static site generator feature, but the main focus is SSR.

-	**[Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)**  Gridsome is highly inspired by Gatsby.js (React.js based), which collects data sources and generates a static site from it. Gridsome is an alternative for Gatsby.js.
